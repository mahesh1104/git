What is meant by version control?

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time 
so that you can recall specific versions later.


Version control systems are a category of software tools that help a software team manage changes to source code over time. 
Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database.

Centralized version control
You pull the files that you need, but you never have a full copy of your project locally
 Subversion (SVN) and Perforce.

Distributed version control
Instead, you clone a copy of a repository locally so that you have the full history of the project
Git or Mercurial


Git what it will do is , locally it will control you are version's

git status -s
git log --oneline

git checkout -- commit level checkout(read only), file level checkout
